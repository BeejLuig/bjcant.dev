Welcome to my new site, bjcant.dev! This will be the new home of my writings on web development, particularly in the front-end space. My old website, https://bjcantlupe.com, will remain up as an archive of posts and projects from the beginning of my career in technology. Someday it will be repurposed, but for now I like it as a friendly reminder of what it took to get where I am today.

**_what's the deal with this site?_**

After taking a two-year "hiatus" (\*cough\*-_lazy_-\*cough\*), I am finally following through with a personal goal to give back to the dev community. Not only do I want to share what I have learned while working as a web developer, but I also recognize that participating in the dev community is one of **the best ways to learn**.

So I want to start by talking about this site. The goal was to create something with a single purpose, free of distractions -- _just a blog_. I wanted to build it in a weekend, and that's exactly what happened! It's a work in progress, but as I have learned: _everything is a work in progress_. I will add related posts along with new features and improvements.

A few things on the `TODO` list:
- Refactor CSS to utilize CSS modules
- Refactor template file structure
- Add light mode (I guess)
- Update SEO stuff
- Add a "read time" feature, a la Medium
- Cross-post to Dev.to via RSS feed

This site was built using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), the insanely popular static site generator backed by React and GraphQL. It was bootstrapped using [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and styled with the [tachyons-verbose](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons-verbose) CSS library. The color palette was pseudo-generated from somewhere I can't remember. I chose to start with a dark theme because frankly, light backgrounds give me headaches. The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which is _easily_ the quickest and smoothest deployment pipeline setup I have ever gone through. 

**_what's next?_**

More posts! I am challenging myself to write at least two posts a week -- we'll see how that goes. If you'd like to learn more about me and/or get in touch, I'd love to hear from you!
